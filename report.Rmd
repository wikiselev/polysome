This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, purl=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("functions.R")
initialize_gene_sets()
t <- res.l.le.deseq[!(res.l.le.deseq$ensembl_gene_id %in% rownames(le)), ]
t <- t[order(t$gene_length),]
p <- ggplot(t, aes(gene_length)) +
        geom_histogram() +
	scale_x_log10()
p
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
